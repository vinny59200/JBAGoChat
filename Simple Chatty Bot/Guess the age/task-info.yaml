    Hello! My name is Aid.
    I was created in 2020.
    Please, remind me your name.
    > John
    What a great name you have, John!
    Let me guess your age.
    Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
    > 1
    > 2
    > 1
    Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
    Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
